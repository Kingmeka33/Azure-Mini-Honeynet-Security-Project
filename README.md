# Azure-Mini-Honeynet-Security-Project
# 🛡️ Azure Mini Honeynet Security Project

## 📘 Introduction

In this project, I build a **mini honeynet in Azure** and ingest logs from various resources into a **Log Analytics Workspace**, which is then used by **Microsoft Sentinel** to build attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents.

I measured key security metrics in the insecure environment for 24 hours, applied security controls to harden the environment, and then measured the metrics again for another 24 hours.

The metrics collected are:

- `SecurityEvent` (Windows Event Logs)
- `Syslog` (Linux Event Logs)
- `SecurityAlert` (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- `SecurityIncident` (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- `AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL` (Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet)

### 📈 After Hardening

> No attack map results — Sentinel detected **no malicious activity** during the hardened 24-hour period.
